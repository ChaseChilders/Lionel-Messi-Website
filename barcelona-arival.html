    <p>
      Messi was only 16 years old when he first made his debut with Barcelona's
      first team. He went on as a super-sub in a friendly against Porto. His
      performance in this game allowed him to find a practice spot on the first
      team and eventually become a starting player. By the time he was 18 years
      old, he signed a contract with Barcelona with a buyout clause of over 150
      million.

    <h2>Move to PSG</h2>
    <p>
      Since his move to PSG, Messi has not been the same player he once was at
      Barcelona. He has been forced to play more of a support role which does
      not allow his individual brilliance to show.
    </p>
    <p>
      This isn't the only reason, however. Lionel Messi joined a team with
      Kylian Mbappe and Neymar Jr., two of the best players in the world.
      Sharing the ball between all three of them is very challenging, and at
      times, one is left out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only time will tell if Messi can return to his former greatness, and once
      again become the best player in the world. There is no doubt, however,
      that he will go down as the greatest player in the history of soccer.
